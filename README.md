Using the models obtained through Simulink simulation, an algorithm has been devised to predict crucial characteristics of LIG. This algorithm provides valuable insight into LIG's conductivity, sheet resistance, and morphology, taking into account the myriad configurable and multivariate laser parameters involved in the fabrication process. The algorithm flowchart, as depicted in figure  outlines its step-by-step operation. Initially, the laser fluency, power density and peak power values are obtained from the laser configurable and fixed parameters through the simulation. These values serve as foundational indicators. Subsequently, the algorithm classifies the whether the resulting sample exhibits conductivity or not, acting as a fundamental binary distinction. For samples deemed conductive, the algorithm proceeds to calculate the sheet resistance, a critical metric in assessing the material's electrical performance. Furthermore, the algorithm also provides insights into the morphology of the conductive LIG sample, enabling researchers and engineers to gain a comprehensive understanding of its structural properties. This predictive algorithm is instrumental in streamlining the LIG fabrication process and allows for informed decision-making in optimizing its properties for specific applications.
